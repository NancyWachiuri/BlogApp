# PitchApp Application.


Welcome to our Pitch Application. 

In life, you only have 60 seconds to impress someone. 1 minute can make or break you. How do we make sure that you use your 1 minute to actually say something meaningful?

PitchApp is an application that allows you to use that one minute wisely. You will submit their one minute pitches and other users will vote on them and leave comments to give their feedback on them.
